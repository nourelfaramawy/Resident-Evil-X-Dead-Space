# Project Name: Unity Survival Horror Game

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase the basic and innovative Unity skills by creating a fully functioning game. Inspired by popular titles like Resident Evil 2 (2019), Resident Evil 4 (2023), and Dead Space (2023), this game places players in the shoes of a character named Leon, facing mindless enemies and making strategic decisions based on resource management.

### Gameplay Overview

In the game, players control Leon from a third-person perspective, navigating through various rooms, fighting enemies, and making use of available resources. The gameplay experience should last between 5 to 10 minutes, offering a mix of combat, exploration, and decision-making.

## Player Mechanics

### Health Points and Movement

Leon starts with 8 health points, which can decrease when attacked by enemies. Movement is controlled using standard movement buttons, with the option to sprint for faster traversal.

### Primary Weapons

Leon can equip different primary weapons, each with unique properties such as firing mode, damage amount, and range. Weapons include a Pistol, Assault Rifle, Shotgun, and Revolver, each serving different combat needs.

### Grenades

Grenades are vital tools for both offense and defense. Leon can equip and throw grenades to damage enemies or break free from enemy grapples. Hand Grenades cause explosive damage, while Flash Grenades stun enemies.

### Knife

Leon's knife serves as a versatile tool for close combat and escaping enemy grapples. It has durability points that can be replenished through repair. The knife can be used to finish off knocked-down enemies or break free from grapples.

### Interactions

Leon can interact with objects in the environment, triggering various actions such as picking up items or unlocking doors.

## Resource Management

### Gold Coins

Gold coins serve as the primary currency in the game, used for purchasing items and services from the store.

### Inventory

Leon's inventory has limited space, requiring players to manage their items carefully. It displays crucial information such as health points, equipped weapon, and available resources.

### Store

The store allows Leon to buy and sell items, as well as repair his knife for a fee.

### Items

Items such as herbs, mixtures, gunpowder, grenades, weapons, ammo, treasures, and key-items play essential roles in the game, providing health restoration, ammunition, and progression.

## Main Level

The main level comprises interconnected rooms filled with enemies, items, and locked doors. Players must navigate through these rooms, defeat enemies, collect resources, and unlock doors to progress.

### Enemies

Enemies have varying behaviors and attacks, engaging Leon upon detection. Combat involves strategic positioning, weapon selection, and resource management.

### Level Design

The level design incorporates safe rooms, combat rooms, item rooms, and locked doors, providing a balanced mix of exploration and combat challenges. Leon should collect key cards to be able to navigate through the level, unlock doors, collect resources for survival, defeat enemies, and ultimately unlocking the final room, the time machine to be able to escape. 

Happy gaming! ðŸŽ®
